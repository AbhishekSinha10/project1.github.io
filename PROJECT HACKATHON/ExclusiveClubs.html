                    IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It is the world's largest
                    professional association advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of
                    humanity.
                    Most people would look at the name and think, “I’m not in ECE or EEE, what is the point of joining
                    IEEE?” This is a completely false notion. IEEE-NITK has three main SIGs(Special Interest Groups)
                    which cater to students of all branches of engineering. So even if you are in Chemical or CS, IEEE
                    has something for you. After all, what’s in a name?
                    The three SIGs of IEEE are:

                    a)CompSoc, is a conglomeration of students with a passion for Computer Science and Information
                    Technology.

                    b)Piston, is a special interest group dedicated to the engineering applications of Mechanical,
                    Automation, Civil, Chemical and Material Sciences.

                    c)Diode, is a team of students with a strong interest in the field of Electronics and Electrical
                    Science.

                    In general, non-circuit branches (Mech, Chemical, Meta, Mining, Civil) come under Piston, IT/CSE
                    under Python and ECE/EEE under Diode. However, you can join whichever SIG you want based on your
                    interest. It is not dependent on your branch.

                    IEEE regularly hosts workshops for the students where they can learn about things like Python,
                    JavaScript, etc (Python SIG), CATIA (Piston SIG) and Op-Amps (Diode SIG). In addition they host
                    various events and games throughout the year which are quite fun to attend.
