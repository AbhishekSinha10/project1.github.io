        The BAJA Team builds an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) to take part in the BAJA Competition. Students have to take part in all stages of these competitions, such as marketing and fund raising and not just building the car. Students have to stay back in college for a couple of weeks in the holidays, but the experience and knowledge gained is well worth the sacrifice.</p>

        Quizzing organizes quizzes, debates, plays and much, much more. Usually these are team events (2-3 people) and are good fun to participate in. Quizzes on movies, tech, G.K., lit and any topic they can think of are conducted regularly in both semesters.

      A great chance for non-performers to also overcome their apprehensions and participate - believe me, events like these make college life memorable! It is also a golden opportunity to interact with seniors. DDFC also organises ‘Jukebox’ which involves Pictionary, Dumb charades and fun movie quizzes. As first years one can participate in all these events but the recruitment is done in second year only.

      The recruitment process consists of resume writing and then audition (with Personal Interview). You can contact any senior for details regarding the interviews. In NITK , no interview is totally technical. The seniors will always be playful with you. In DDFC, you will be asked to showcase the best of your talents.
